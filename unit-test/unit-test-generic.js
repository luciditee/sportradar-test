// The basic gist is just "given known inputs, compare for known output."
// If something doesn't match up, you know it's a fail and you can throw
// the appropriate exception/error/etc.
//
// There are better unit testing systems out there, but this is good
// enough for the sake of shorter turnaround and maintaining my personal
// policy of "write tests as you go" instead of waiting until the end
// to integrate some Enterprise Grade, Maximum Overkillâ„¢ testing suite.
